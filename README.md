# Conway's Game of Life

## Based on 4 rules:
* A living cell dies if it has fewer than two living neighboring cells.
* A living cell with two or three living neighbors lives on.
* A living cell with more than three living neighboring cells dies in the next time step.
* A dead cell is revived if it has exactly three living neighboring cells.
